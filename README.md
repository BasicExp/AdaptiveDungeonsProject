# Adaptive Dungeons Project
This project is a completely open source set of libraries that are intended to be used by game makers of any skill level to create Role-Playing Games (RPGs) in any C#-friendly game engine.

The design decisions of this project puts the ease of comprehension and utilization of these tools ahead of all other general accepted and practiced principles.

## AdaptiveRPG
This is the collection of modular C# (.NET 6) libraries made of RPG systems that can be used as-is or iterated against to build a custom RPG system.

The intention is to create plug-and-play modular structures and logic that will allow someone with absolutely no coding experience to pick a system, add something like a single line of code and have an RPG system ready to go.

## TestGrounds

This a predefined .NET 6 console application that exists for the purpose of allowing you to immediately be able to mess around with the AdaptiveRPG libraries.

Code in this project is ephemeral and will not be tracked across versions or releases.

# Road Map
The timeline for this project is highly nebulous and based on the bandwidth of the primary developer. This is a passion project that is not expected to every make a dollar and as such, it will be worked on as time and interest allows.

# NoMana System
The first system being added to the AdaptiveRPG project is a turn-based RPG system that forgoes the traditional usage of the ability-restricting resource management of "mana". The intention is to simplify character and combat systems to be balanced around a single mechanic, "speed".
